## Introduction

{% embed url="https://nmap.org/" %}

Nmap is a security scanner for network exploration and hacking. It allows you to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network. It sends specially crafted packets to the target host and then analyzes the responses to accomplish its goal. Either a network administrator or an attacker can use this tool for their specific needs.
